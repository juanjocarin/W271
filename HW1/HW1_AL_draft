#Data
**The file birthweight w271.RData contains data from the 1988 National Health Inter-
view Survey, which may have been modifed by the instructors to test your profciency.
This survey is conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau and has collected data on individ-
ual health metrics since 1957. Like all surveys, a full analysis would require advanced
techniques such as those provided by the R survey package. For this exercise, however,
you are to treat the data as a true random sample. You will use this dataset to practice
interpreting OLS coeffcients.**

#Exercises
```{r, eval=TRUE}
library(plyr)
library(car)
```

##Question 1:
**Load the birthweight dataset. Note that the actual data is provided in a data table
named "data".**

**Use the following procedures to load the data:**

**Step 1: put the provided R Workspace birthweight w271.RData in the directory of your
choice.**


**Step 2: Load the dataset using this command: load(\\birthweight:Rdata)**

```{r, eval=TRUE}
load ("\\birthweight_w271.Rdata")

```

##Question 2:
**Examine the basic structure of the data set using desc, str, and summary to examine all
of the variables in the data set. How many variables and observations in the data?
These commands will be useful:**

1. desc

```{r, eval=TRUE}
desc

```

2. str(data)

```{r, eval=TRUE}
str(data)

```

3. summary(data)

```{r, eval=TRUE}
summary(data)

```

There are 14 variables in the dataset, and there are  1388 observations. 

##Question 3:
**As we mentioned in the live session, it is important to start with a question (or a hy-
pothesis) when conducting regression modeling. In this execrise, we are in the question:
"Do mothers who smoke have babies with lower birth weight?"**

**The dependent variable of interested is bwght, representing birthweight in ounces. Ex-
amine this variable using both tabulated summary and graphs. Specifcally,**

1. **Summarize the variable bwght: summary(data\$bwght)**

```{r, eval=TRUE}
summary(data$bwght)

```

2. **You may also use the quantile function: quantile(data$bwght). List the following
quantiles: 1%, 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%, 99%**

```{r, eval=TRUE}
quantile(data$bwght)
quantile(data$bwght, seq(0, 1, .01))

```

3. **Plot the histogram of bwght and comment on the shape of its distribution. Try dif-
ferent bin sizes and comment how it affects the shape of the histogram. Remember
to label the graph clearly. You will also need a title for the graph.**

```{r, eval=TRUE}
hist(data$bwght)

hist(data$bwght, breaks=50, main= 'Historgram of Birth Weights')

```

The shape of the histogram becomes smoother and closer to a normal distribution as the number of bins increases. 

4. **This is a more open-ended question: Have you noticed anything "strange" with the
bwght variable and the shape of histogram this variable? If so, please elaborate on
your observations and investigate any issues you have identifed.**


##Question 4:

**Examine the variable cigs, which represents number of cigarettes smoked each day by the
mother while pregnant. Conduct the same analysis as in question 3.**

```{r, eval=TRUE}
summary(data$cigs)

```

```{r, eval=TRUE}

quantile(data$cigs, seq(0,1,.01))

```

```{r, eval=TRUE}
hist(data$cigs)

hist(data$cigs, breaks=10, main= 'Historgram of Cigs')
```

The cigs data is very skewed towards zero, so increasing the bin width doesn't necessarily provide a better view of the data. 

##Question 5:

**Generate a scatterplot of bwght against cigs. Based on the appearance of this plot, how
much of the variation in bwght do you think can be explained by cigs?**


```{r, eval=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
p1<-ggplot(data, aes(x=cigs, y=bwght))
p1 + geom_point()
```



##Question 6:

**Estimate the simple linear regression of bwght on cigs. What coeffcient estimates and
the standard errors associated with the coeffcient estimates do you get Interpret the
results. Note that you may have to "take care of" any potential data issues before build-
ing a regression model.**

```{r, eval=TRUE}
#take car of any problems here

```

```{r, eval=TRUE}
#creating the linear model 
lmBwghtCig<-lm(bwght~cigs, data=data)

lmBwghtCig

summary(lmBwghtCig)

plot(lmBwghtCig)

```

##Question 7:

**Now, introduce a new independent variable, faminc, representing family income in thou-
sands of dollars. Examine this variable using the same analysis as in question 3. In
addition, produce a scatterplot matrix of bwght, cigs, and faminc. Use the following
command (as a starting point):**

**library(car)**

**scatterplot:matrix( bwght + cigs + faminc; data = data2)**

**Note that the car package is needed in order to use the scatterplot.matrix function.**


```{r, eval=TRUE}
summary(data$faminc)

```

```{r, eval=TRUE}
quantile(data$faminc, seq(0,1,.01))

```

```{r, eval=TRUE}
hist(data$faminc)

hist(data$faminc, breaks=5, main= 'Historgram of Faminc')

```

```{r, eval=TRUE}
scatterplot.matrix(~bwght + cigs + faminc, data = data, main='Scatterplot of bwght, cigs, and famic')
```


##Question 8:

**Regress bwgth on both cigs and faminc. What coeffcient estimates and the standard
errors associated with the coeffcient estimates do you get? Interpret the results.**

```{r, eval=TRUE}
#creating the linear model 
lmBCF<-lm(bwght~cigs+faminc, data=data)

lmBCF

summary(lmBCF)

plot(lmBCF)

```

##Question 9:

**Explain, in your own words, what the coeffcient on cigs in the multiple regression means,
and how it is different than the coeffcient on cigs in the simple regression? Please provide
the intuition to explain the difference, if any.**

##Question 10:

**Which coeffcient for cigs is more negative than the other? Suggest an explanation for
why this is so.**
