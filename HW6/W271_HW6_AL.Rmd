## Exercise 1

a. **Discuss the mean and variance functions and how the similarities and differences from those we studied in classical linear model.**

The mean function for a time series is deinfed by the function:

$$ \mu_x (t) = E(x_t) = \int_{- \infty}^{+ \infty} x_t f_t(x_t)dx_t$$

This function has a time component so the mean could be different in different time periods. This is different from a mean in classical linear models where the mean is constant.

The variance functions for a time series analys is defined by the function:

$$\sigma_x^2(t) = E(x_t-\mu_x(t))^2 = \int_{- \infty}^{+ \infty} (x_t-\mu_x(t))^2F_t(x_t)dx_t$$

Again this function is time dependant which means it varies with time unlike the variance in a classical linear model. 

...

b. **Define strict and weak statonarity**

Statonarity indicates the parameter is consistent is accross time. 

Strict stationary is when the joint distributions $F(x_{t_1}, ..., x_{t_n})$ and $F(x_{t_1+m}, ..., x_{t_n+m})$ are the same impling that the distribution is unchanged for any time shift. 

Weak stationarity (also called second-order stationary) is when its mean and variancec stationary and its autocovariance $Cov(x_t, x_{t+k})$ depends on teh time placement k and can be written as $\gamma^{(k)}$. Once a distribution assumption is imposed the series can be completely characterized by the mean and covariance.
